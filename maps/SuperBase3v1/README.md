Theoretically, this is a 3v2 map, but an additional team for player 3 acts as a 
kind of "Research Support." It can be disabled to make the battle more challenging or easier. 
This map was created when it was not yet possible to place buildings beyond the limit.

My Recommendation for a game: Team A (0,1,2) VS Team B (3 + 4 as a "Research Support")
Info about Teams:
Team 0,1 - Medium Oil, Low-Mid Defenses
Team 2 - Low oil (After Invasion), Low-Mid Defenses
Team 3 - Insane Oil, High-Extreme Defenses
Team 4 - Research Support for Team 3
